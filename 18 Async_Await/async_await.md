# async/await

async/await is a modern way to handle asynchronous operations in JavaScript, built on top of Promises. async/await handles asynchronous operations in a more synchronous-looking manner.

## Working of async/await

- The `async` keyword is used to define a function that handles asynchronous operations.
- The `await` keyword is used inside an `async` function to wait for a Promise to resolve or reject before moving to the next line of code.
